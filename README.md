Right now, I’m diving into web development, getting into `Angular` for the front-end and `Java Spring` for the back-end. I have a solid background in e-commerce, but I’m aiming to shift into a programming career that goes beyond just that. 

On a personal note, I’m all about cats, gaming, anime, medieval series, and love hosting dinner parties at home with close friends. I tend to be shy in large crowds but become the chatterbox in small groups.
